## factor

Issues with factor:

- No match between labels and codes
- No support for hierarchical structure
- In (production) code, codes (at different levels) are often used
- For visualisation/tabulation/analysis labels are often more practical

## Result

Current result of unConf:

- 'classification' object
- Allow user to 'cast' codes to 
    - labels
    - higher levels

## Example classification: business actvity (NACE)

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(categorical)
data("nace_rev2")
print(nace_rev2, short = TRUE)
```

## Example 

```{r, echo=FALSE}
df <- data.frame(
  id = 1:200,
  activity = sample(nace_rev2[[4]]$id, 200),
  some_number = runif(200),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
```

```{r}
print(head(df))
```

```{r}
table(cast_level(df$activity, nace_rev2, level = 1, label = FALSE))
```



## Example of use within dplyr

```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(cast_level(activity, level = 1, label = F) == "A") %>%
  group_by(activity = cast_level(activity, level = 3)) %>%
  summarise(some_total = sum(some_number))
```

## To do

- Code is in package that passes `R CMD check`
- Write tests
- Utility functions, e.g. relevel, recode
- Different versions of labels, e.g. translations
- ...
